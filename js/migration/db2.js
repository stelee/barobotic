There are several thousand brands of whiskey available, all with a different taste and quality. The taste and quality may even be different from one vintage to another.There are three main American whiskey types:     Straight whiskey is made from at least 51 percent of a      grain.

The finished product, diluted with water, must be at      least 80 proof. Typical straight whiskeys are Bourbon,      Rye whiskey, and Tennessee whiskey (see related      ingredients).   Light whiskey is distilled to higher than 160 proof and      diluted with more water than straight whiskey. It is then stored      in charred oak barrels. Light whiskeys are mainly used for      blending.   Blended whiskey is made from a combination of two or      more 100 proof straight whiskeys, blended with neutral spirits or      light whiskeys. At least 20 percent of the blend must be straight      whiskey. (See related ingredients)    Straight whiskey is made from at least 51 percent of a      grain.
